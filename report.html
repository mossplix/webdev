            <h3>Intoduction</h3>

            The Essential Story being told by this portifolio site, is of a story of a proffesional 
            AI engineer, who has pushed boundaries in creating applications where technology and humans intersect in meaningful ways.

            The site is a collection of projects, media appearances, and testimonials that showcase my work and impact on the world. It shows my journey from a  traditional software engineer to a leading developer of quirky AI products. 
            The site is designed to be engaging, informative, and a little bit whimsical, reflecting my approach to technology and creativity.

            The main people the portifolio is trying to reach are potential clients, collaborators, and employers who are interested in my work and want to learn more about me. The site is also for tech enthusiasts who want to see how AI can be used in playful and innovative ways.

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>


<b>1. I used  Use ARIA roles and Add Alt Text for Images to define regions of the page. </b></br>

I used ARIA roles and alt text to help users who rely on assistive technologies to navigate the site easily. By providing clear descriptions and defining page regions, I made the site content more accessible to individuals with visual impairments .</br>


<b>2. Ensure text has sufficient contrast against the background using a good color scheme. </b></br>

By Ensuring sufficient contrast between text and background colors I  enhanced the readability and usability for all users, especially those with visual impairments. </br>

<b>3.  Used semantic HTML elements where appropriate.</b></br>

I used Semantic HTML elements provide meaning and structure to web content. The tags used include header, nav, main,  section, and footer. These elements help assistive technologies understand the purpose and organization of content.</br>

            <h3>Learnings</h3>


<b>1.Media Queries in css  And Responsive design in general</b> </br>

I didnt have alot of experience with responsive design especially given that I have mostly used css frameworks to aceheive responsiveness.
 I learnt how to use media queries to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. I mostly looked at how some of the libraries acheive this as well as 
 online resources like w3schools and MDN web docs.</br>


 <b>2. Creating good color palletes </b> </br>

Inorder to come up with a good color scheme for a futuristic portifolio website, I needed to learn about color theory and how to create harmonious color palettes.
I used online tools like Coolors and Adobe Color to experiment with different color combinations and find the right balance between contrast and harmony.
 I also learnt how to use color psychology to evoke specific emotions and create a cohesive visual identity for the site.</br>




 <b>3. Accessibility Patterns</b></br>

I researched more about accessibility standards especially the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). 
The WCAG provides detailed guidelines for making web content accessible to a wide range of users.  This helped me to understand the importance of creating accessible websites and how to implement best practices for accessibility.

            <h3>Evaluation 1</h3>

            The  spect of my work dthat I think were particularly successful are the use of the color scheme that captures the futuristic theme of the site. I also think the typography and layout are clean and easy to read, which enhances the user experience.
            The site is also well-structured and easy to navigate, with clear sections that provide an overview of my work and achievements.

            <h3>Evaluation 2</h3>

             While I have implemented some accessibility features, such as ARIA roles and alt text, there are areas where I could further enhance the site’s accessibility. For example,
             I could improve keyboard navigation and focus styles to make the site more user-friendly for individuals who rely on assistive technologies.
                I could also conduct user testing with individuals who use screen readers to identify any barriers to accessibility and make necessary improvements.

                The site loading speed could also be improved by minification and bundling techniques, which would enhance the overall user experience and make the site more accessible to users with slower internet connections.
